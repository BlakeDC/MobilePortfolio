# About Me

---

Hello! My name is **Blake Munro**, and I am currently a 3rd-year **Computer Programming** student at **Durham College**. I am passionate about technology and software development, and I am proud to be an honor roll student. Throughout my academic journey, I've gained valuable experience in various areas of development, from building websites to working on mainframes, cloud platforms, mobile apps, and even games.

I’m passionate about staying active and work out regularly to keep a positive mindset and a healthy lifestyle. I also love learning new things—right now, I’m studying French to stay connected with my family, improve my communication skills, and open up new opportunities. When I’m not working out or practicing French, you’ll probably find me caring for my fish. Fishkeeping has become a big part of my life, and I’m dedicated to creating a thriving, diverse aquatic ecosystem.

### Professional Experience

Currently, I work at **Playdium** as a **zipline operator** and **event host**. My job has provided me with strong customer service skills, as well as the ability to manage and prioritize tasks efficiently while keeping safety at the forefront.

### Projects and Experience

I have a diverse set of skills and have worked on a variety of projects in different domains of software development. Here are some key areas where I have hands-on experience:

- **Web Development**: From front-end design to back-end logic, I have built responsive websites and applications using modern tools and technologies.
  
- **Mainframe Development**: I have experience working with legacy systems, contributing to projects that require specialized knowledge in COBOL and mainframe environments.
  
- **Cloud Computing**: My experience includes deploying and managing applications in cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, utilizing infrastructure-as-code, and serverless technologies.
  
- **Game Development**: Creating interactive and engaging games is another area of interest. I have worked on both 2D and 3D games, focusing on gameplay mechanics and user experience.
  
- **Mobile Development**: I have developed mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms, understanding the unique challenges of creating efficient and user-friendly mobile interfaces.
